				<p>After 6 months as a Product Manager, I wanted to reflect on a few things: why the career switch, how I got into the role and how I feel about the role so far.</p>
<h2>Why Product Management?</h2>
<p>After 2 years an a BI analyst, I was increasingly interested in whether the decisions we’ve made as a data team was the “right” one for our business. I define right as:</p>
<ul>
<li>does it solve the problems of the teams that we support?</li>
<li>was the effort to implement it worth it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding user problems is at the core of Product Management and in the case of a data team, our users were the other teams in the company.</p>
<p>Taking the time to think through the decision making processes that I’ve been a part of made it painfully obvious that many of them were not “right”. As I delved deeper into the internal user problems faced by the company, my time was getting hard to manage for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.carmenkung.com/deep-work-and-its-role-in-product-management/">Deep thinking</a> is required for both strategic thinking and analytical thinking. That takes time.</li>
<li>Being part of the technical team that implements the solution represents a conflict of interest when it comes to making the right calls for the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>What spurred me into looking into Product Management was that it was these thoughts were what kept me awake at night, not my work as an analyst. It was clear to me what my next career step should be.</p>
<h2>Finding a job</h2>
<p>Logical next step? Look for an opening. Easier said than done. As with every position, no matter how relevant your experience is, as long as you have not been in the exact role, it can be hard to pivot. Hiring process these days are semi-automated and it can be hard to pass the sniff test if you don’t have <em>Product Manager</em> written on your CV. Clicking “apply” was as good as throwing my CV into the bin.</p>
<p>The best thing to do would probably be to network myself to death despite the pandemic by taking over social media channels where tech people go hang out:Twitter and Linkedin. But I wasn’t a fan of social media.</p>
<p>What did I do then? <strong>I looked for openings internally on a different part of the business</strong> which is not dissimilar to getting a coffee chat over Twitter and asking for a recommendation. Puts my CV on top of the pile so human eyes get to see it. Going for a role in a different function, which means not in a data team, would also expose me to a different part of the business. Staying stagnant never helped anyone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An internal transfer is probably the easiest way to pivot in your career if you are already in a company that offers a role that you would be interested in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t mean you don’t have to work extremely hard to convince your future colleagues that:</p>
<p><strong>A. You know what the role is about</strong></p>
<p>Many aspiring PMs don’t actually but this post isn’t about that.</p>
<p><strong>B. They want to work with you for the next 2 years</strong></p>
<p>Which you can fake but you’ll probably be better off in the long run being genuine in the interview. You’ll have to work with these people too.</p>
<p>I worked hard for the interviews to make up for the “lack of relevant experience” and it worked. I finally got a foot in the door of Product Management.</p>
<h2>How were the first 6 months?</h2>
<p>My motivations for the role were related to marrying user problems and solutions but I’m a little more sceptical now than when I first started out. PMs, especially new ones like myself, can often encounter some expected strategic challenges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are saddled with the burden of strategic thinking that we lack the experience to perform while having to adjusting to the challenges of a new role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This happens because often our managers don’t have a product strategy and sometimes lack the skills to walk us through the process of developing one. This information isn’t found in books. Read <em>The Lean Startup? The ONE Thing?</em> Books don’t contain practical advise on how to go about this in the complete absence of one.</p>
<p>A more experienced and skilled PM will know how to go about this and just with developers, there will be camps of people who support one way over another (I think healthy discourse is fantastic but if you’re too stubborn then you’ll be bad in a team but that’s a topic for another day).</p>
<h3>Is it all bad?</h3>
<p>No not at all! I’ve delved more deeply into product development than I had expected to and have also developed strategies to improve myself and the practices of my team. This is something I will continue to build upon as I progress but I hope that sharing my early learnings here will help someone in a similar stage of their career or are looking to break into PM.</p>
<p><strong>Don't fixate on what you can't fix</strong></p>
<p>I work in a corporate startup, which means grand expansion plans often take precedence over positively impacting the bottom line. The sooner I accepted that the less blue I felt about the instructions that I get from top down. The fate of the company isn’t in your hands and if you spend too much time fixating in things you can’t fix, the harder you’ll have to fight yourself to work hard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.carmenkung.com/power-of-habit/">Willpower is like a muscle</a> so don’t spend it on things that aren’t worth it. Agile coach getting in your way? <a href="https://corporate-rebels.com/hippo-effect/">HiPPO</a> (highest paid person’s opinion) trying to undermine you? Just consider it as time wasted and instead focus on what you can achieve. Easier said than done but well worth striving for.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<p>This seems to be the first thing thrown out the window when people get busy. Every decision needs to have a how and why, even if they aren't good ones. Read up on how successful companies produce documentation and base your work off theirs eg. Amazon press releases <a href="https://andreamarchiotto.medium.com/amazon-press-release-how-to-55d61188ecdd">(link to an article on this)</a>. If your company doesn't have a good documentation, it's likely that no one will ever read your work anyway so just treat it as practice</p>
<p><strong>Create data driven records even if there isn't data driven decision making</strong></p>
<p>Real life example from my third day as a PM. &quot;Let's get abc to do xyz. How will this be profitable? Don't worry I've already sorted out the business case so you just focus on delivering.&quot;</p>
<p>Classic example of top-down requests that come without broader strategy and PMs are just expected to deliver a solution that once again doesn't help the bottom line. Depending on the company, you might even be held accountable for the results which can be tricky during probation.</p>
<p>What I've opted to do which has helped with accountability to the company and to myself is to record in detail every decision (hence why documentation is so important) and show clear figures as early as possible + solid analysis. In some companies, you might not have access to product analysts so this is a good time to learn some SQL and get back into the &quot;school mindset&quot; and report on the project like it was a science experiment. A good report on a bad project is more valuable than an okay report on a good project. Things fail all the time so we need know why they failed.</p>
<p><strong>Learn from everyone</strong></p>
<p>One of my first &quot;learnings&quot; was that good product work, unless you are extremely experienced, requires one to be more technical in more areas than I had expected. Ex-developer turned PM? Great, continue learning, you probably should start learning product analysis. Ex-analyst? More to learn in engineering. Ex-designer? Well, time to start getting technical.</p>
<p>I have met PMs who have been in the game significantly longer who pride themselves in not being technical. Let's just say they get little respect from their team and often struggle to understand the tradeoffs that have to be made when it comes to making decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Humility: Sometimes you are just a shield for your developers</strong></p>
<p>This can be a tough pill to swallow for some PMs are not &quot;thought leaders&quot; or “CEOs of the Product”. Thought frameworks? Don’t try to be perfect when you’re just starting out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the things I do daily ensuring as little ambiguity gets to my developers lest as possible. I’m not there yet but I am working at it as it is one thing brings genuine value to my team <em>every single day.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developers don't need to be involved in the 5 meetings it took to make a decision. Especially when the strategic direction is often unclear. What I do is craft a &quot;why and what&quot; to the developers for them to give me a &quot;how&quot;. If I've done my job correctly there should be no doubt in the engineer's mind why and what the business wants to achieve. The clearer the goal the better your team can start thinking about how they want to implement things.</p>
<p>My work from here on is to shield them for the time it takes them to get it done. Sometimes I am just a glorified shield that creates a safe space for the developers to work in. That’s not easy and it is something I should be proud to get better at.</p>
<h2>Thoughts about the role</h2>
<p>I love this job. I've been in a few different roles for a few years each and none of them have really clicked with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good PM in my head is a magical mix of great EQ and technical understanding, constantly bridging the different aspects of the business while remaining close to the customers experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanna be this magical person. It's hard to define what getting there entails and when I have &quot;gotten there&quot; but my experience so far has shown me this is a path I want to continue walking even if my job title no longer says PM in a few years.</p>
<p><strong>What am I doing now?</strong>
Aside from the improving soft skills that I mentioned, I am also trying to fill in my knowledge gaps of my knowledge on the Frontend side of things by picking up some html, css and javascript. Knowing a little bit about everything is always good and technical pursuits give me much needed bursts of “I did it” on days when the going gets hard.</p>

What I do is craft a &quot;why and what&quot; to the developers for them to give me a &quot;how&quot;. If I've done my job correctly there should be no doubt in the engineer's mind why and what the business wants to achieve. The clearer the goal the better your team can start thinking about how they want to implement things.</p>
<p>My work from here on is to shield them for the time it takes them to get it done. Sometimes I am just a glorified shield that creates a safe space for the developers to work in. That’s not easy and it is something I should be proud to get better at.</p>
<h2>Thoughts about the role</h2>
<p>I love this job. I've been in a few different roles for a few years each and none of them have really clicked with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good PM in my head is a magical mix of great EQ and technical understanding, constantly bridging the different aspects of the business while remaining close to the customers experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanna be this magical person. It's hard to define what getting there entails and when I have &quot;gotten there&quot; but my experience so far has shown me this is a path I want to continue walking even if my job title no longer says PM in a few years.</p>
<p><strong>What am I doing now?</strong></p>
<p>Aside from the above, I am also trying to incorporate Deep Thinking into my work which I've shared <a href="https://www.carmenkung.com/deep-work-and-its-role-in-product-management/">here</a>. On the technical side, I am filling in my knowledge gaps on the Frontend side of things by picking up some html, css and javascript. Knowing a little bit about everything is always good and technical pursuits give me much needed bursts of “I did it” on days when the going gets hard.go</p>
<p>After 6 months as a Product Manager, I wanted to reflect on a few things: why the career switch, how I got into the role and how I feel about the role so far.</p>
<h2>Why Product Management?</h2>
<p>After 2 years an a BI analyst, I was increasingly interested in whether the decisions we’ve made as a data team was the “right” one for our business. I define right as:</p>
<ul>
<li>does it solve the problems of the teams that we support?</li>
<li>was the effort to implement it worth it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding user problems is at the core of Product Management and in the case of a data team, our users were the other teams in the company.</p>
<p>Taking the time to think through the decision making processes that I’ve been a part of made it painfully obvious that many of them were not “right”. As I delved deeper into the internal user problems faced by the company, my time was getting hard to manage for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.carmenkung.com/deep-work-and-its-role-in-product-management/">Deep thinking</a> is required for both strategic thinking and analytical thinking. That takes time.</li>
<li>Being part of the technical team that implements the solution represents a conflict of interest when it comes to making the right calls for the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>What spurred me into looking into Product Management was that it was these thoughts were what kept me awake at night, not my work as an analyst. It was clear to me what my next career step should be.</p>
<h2>Finding a job</h2>
<p>Logical next step? Look for an opening. Easier said than done. As with every position, no matter how relevant your experience is, as long as you have not been in the exact role, it can be hard to pivot. Hiring process these days are semi-automated and it can be hard to pass the sniff test if you don’t have <em>Product Manager</em> written on your CV. Clicking “apply” was as good as throwing my CV into the bin.</p>
<p>The best thing to do would likely have been to network despite the pandemic by taking over social media channels where tech people hang out: Twitter and Linkedin. But I wasn’t a fan of social media.</p>
<p>What did I do then? <strong>I looked for openings internally on a different part of the business</strong> which is not dissimilar to getting a coffee chat over Twitter and asking for a recommendation. Puts my CV on top of the pile so human eyes get to see it. Going for a role in a different function, which means not in a data team, would also expose me to a different part of the business. Staying stagnant never helped anyone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An internal transfer is probably the easiest way to pivot in your career if you are already in a company that offers a role that you would be interested in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t mean you don’t have to work extremely hard to convince your future colleagues that:</p>
<p><strong>A. You know what the role is about.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you know what the purpose of the role is and how your motivations feed into that.</p>
<p><strong>B. They want to work with you for the next 2 years.</strong></p>
<p>Which you can fake but you’ll probably be better off in the long run being genuine in the interview. You’ll have to work with these people too.</p>
<p>I worked hard for the interviews to make up for the “lack of relevant experience” and it worked. I finally got a foot in the door of Product Management.</p>
<h2>How were the first 6 months?</h2>
<p>My motivations for the role were related to marrying user problems and solutions but I’m a little more sceptical now than when I first started out. PMs, especially new ones like myself, can often encounter some unexpected strategic challenges.</p>
<p>We are saddled with the burden of strategic thinking that we lack the experience to perform while having to adjusting to the challenges of a new role.</p>
<p>Sometimes managers don’t have a product strategy and sometimes lack the skills to walk us through the process of developing one. This information isn’t found in books. Read <em>The Lean Startup? The ONE Thing?</em> Books don’t contain practical advise on how to go about this in the complete absence of one.</p>
<p>A more experienced and skilled PM will know how to go about this and just with developers, there will be camps of people who support one way over another (I think healthy discourse is fantastic but if you’re too stubborn then you’ll be bad in a team but that’s a topic for another day).</p>
<p>This can be particularly disillusioning when you are starting out so don't let it put out your spark. Perhaps the ability to bring value to the company and the team in spite of these challenges will come with time.</p>
<p>I myself have found meaning in applying myself in other ways and am working towards better strategic understanding of my role as I've shared <a href="https://www.carmenkung.com/deep-work-and-its-role-in-product-management/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Learnings</h3>
<p>I’ve delved more deeply into product development than I had expected to and have also developed strategies to improve myself and the practices of my team. This is something I will continue to build upon as I progress but I hope that sharing my early learnings here will help someone in a similar stage of their career or are looking to break into PM.</p>
<p><strong>Don't fixate on what you can't fix</strong></p>
<p>I work in a corporate startup, which means grand expansion plans often take precedence over positively impacting the bottom line. The sooner I accepted that the less blue I felt about the instructions that I get from top down. The fate of the company isn’t in your hands and if you spend too much time fixating in things you can’t fix, the harder you’ll have to fight yourself to work hard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.carmenkung.com/power-of-habit/">Willpower is like a muscle</a> so don’t spend it on things that aren’t worth it. Agile coach getting in your way? <a href="https://corporate-rebels.com/hippo-effect/">HiPPO</a> (highest paid person’s opinion) trying to undermine you? Just consider it as time wasted and instead focus on what you can achieve. Easier said than done but well worth striving for.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<p>This seems to be the first thing thrown out the window when people get busy being busy. Every decision needs to have a how and why, even if they aren't good ones. Read up on how successful companies produce documentation and base your work off theirs eg. Amazon press releases <a href="https://andreamarchiotto.medium.com/amazon-press-release-how-to-55d61188ecdd">(link to an article on this)</a>. If your company doesn't have a good documentation, it's likely that no one will ever read your work anyway so just treat it as practice</p>
<p><strong>Create data driven records even if there isn't data driven decision making</strong></p>
<p>Real life example from my third day as a PM. &quot;Let's get abc to do xyz. How will this be profitable? Don't worry I've already sorted out the business case so you just focus on delivering.&quot;</p>
<p>Classic example of top-down requests that come without broader strategy and PMs are just expected to deliver a solution that once again doesn't help the bottom line. Depending on the company, you might even be held accountable for the results which can be tricky during probation.</p>
<p>What I've opted to do which has helped with accountability to the company and to myself is to record in detail every decision (hence why documentation is so important) and show clear figures as early as possible + solid analysis. In some companies, you might not have access to product analysts so this is a good time to learn some SQL and get back into the &quot;school mindset&quot; and report on the project like it was a science experiment. A good report on a bad project is more valuable than an okay report on a good project. Things fail all the time so we need know why they failed.</p>
<p><strong>Learn from everyone</strong></p>
<p>One of my first &quot;learnings&quot; was that good product work, unless you are extremely experienced, requires one to be more technical in more areas than I had expected. Ex-developer turned PM? Great, continue learning, you probably should start learning product analysis. Ex-analyst? More to learn in engineering. Ex-designer? Well, time to start getting technical.</p>
<p>I have met PMs who have been in the game significantly longer who pride themselves in not being technical. Let's just say they get little respect from their team and often struggle to understand the tradeoffs that have to be made when it comes to making decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Humility: Sometimes you are just a shield for your developers</strong></p>
<p>This can be a tough pill to swallow for some PMs are not &quot;thought leaders&quot; or “CEOs of the Product”. Thought frameworks? Don’t try to be perfect when you’re just starting out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the things I do daily ensuring as little ambiguity gets to my developers lest as possible. I’m not there yet but I am working at it as it is one thing brings genuine value to my team</p>
<p><em>every single day.</em></p>
